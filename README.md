## Description

This project aims to recreate the behavior of the standard C library's `printf` function, allowing for formatted output to the console. By building our own version of `printf`, we gain a deeper understanding of string manipulation, formatting, and handling variadic arguments.

## Features

- Support for formatting specifiers such as `%d`, `%s`, `%c`, `%f`, etc.
- Handling of various flags and width/precision modifiers.
- Custom handling of specific modifiers or behaviors.
